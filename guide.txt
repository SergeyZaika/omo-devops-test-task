Docker and Ansible should be installed for running scripts.

Git repository contains:
1. Dockerfile
Ubuntu 18.04 image

2. After creating Dockerfile there are two ways. 
First way is with inputting my private password for Dockerhub - PASSWDstart_script.sh  
Please input the following command:
vi PASSWDstart_script.sh  
Input my private password instead of 'INPUT_PASSWORD' and save the file. Tha password is sent by Telegram to Anastasia Smidovich
DOCKER_PASS=INPUT_PASSWORD 
The following steps will be done:
- docker build
- push Dockerimage to DockerHub
- pull from DockerHub and run app on localhost:4996 with the help of playbook deploy_run_app.py.yml

The second one is without inputting my private password, without push to Dockerhub, without pull from Dockerhub - start_script_WithoutPushPULL.sh
The following steps will be done:
- docker build
- run app from Dockerimage from HDD on localhost:4996 with the help of playbook WithoutPull_deploy_run_app.py.yml

The thing I want to mention about this project is that to make the whole automation of the project, I need to send password for DockerHub in script. That is not secure.
